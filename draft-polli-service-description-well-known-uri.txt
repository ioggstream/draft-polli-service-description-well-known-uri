1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and

2.  Well-Known URI for Web Services

   This specifications registers the following Well-Known URIs
   associated to the Link Relations defined in [RFC8631].

   Servers MAY use content negotiation (see Section 3.4 of [RFC7231]) to
   provide different types of documentation or description.

   Clients SHOULD NOT make any assumptions about the provided type of
   documentation or description.
